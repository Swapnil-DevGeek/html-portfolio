  Now let me tell you about my schooling. I have done schooling till tenth grade
  in Nashik.I passed out from Delhi Public School in 2020 with 96.4% for which
  my teachers and parents really appreciated me.Then I had to like all others
  complete 11th from home itself due to the very infamous pandemic.I had moved
  to Indore for my JEE coaching in an institute called "Gurukulam". There I had
  to live in hostel with my collegues without any gadgets to avoid any sort of
  distractions.Here I met some of the best minds and many friends.It was a very
  great and overwhelming experience of living such a life.I made through one of
  the toughest exams with 2 years of persistent hardwork.As a result I got
  admission in one of the best engineering institute of the country- the BITS
  pilani.

  I am currently pursuing BE in computer science and kinda exploring a lot of
  stuff.The college life is awesome and very thrilling.I have got the previlege
  to meet the best minds of the country and the best seniors and alumnis. I am
  trying to learn a lot of new stuff here and the environment is also very
  supportative and encouraging. I hope that I make the best use of the resources
  and make my parents proud.
